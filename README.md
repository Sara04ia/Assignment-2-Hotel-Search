# Hotel Dataset Search Engine
This repository contains code to process a hotel dataset and implement a search engine using data from Hugging Face.

## Introduction
This project aims to create a search engine for hotels based on a comprehensive dataset. The search engine allows users to query the dataset for relevant hotel information. The main steps involved in the project include data processing, handling missing data, and building a combined text field for search functionality.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
The following Python libraries:
- pandas
- datasets
- sentence-transformers
- scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Datasets

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sara04ia/hotel-search-engine.git
    cd hotel-search-engine
    ```

## Usage

1. **Process Dataset**:
    ```bash
    python Assignment_2_Hotel_Seach.ipynb
    ```

2. **Search Engine**: Use the processed data for search with `sentence-transformers`.
